# employeeDirectory
This project uses the Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random employees and use that data to build a prototype for a fictional Awesome StartUp employee directory.
The JSON object is requested from the API and that data is parsed so that 12 employees are listed in grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email and address.
Clicking the employee's name or image will open the modal windown with more details.
